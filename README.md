# Privacy Policy (HealthKit)

## What does this cover?

This is a cover-all privacy policy for apps that I have developed that use some sort of health technology, e.g. Apple's HealthKit framework.


## What is collected

Nothing. I literally do not care. No analytics or anything. No information is stored in the app itself (saves data to the Health app) and there is never a transfer of data over the Internet. I do not collect information on the way you use the app. This app is a simple shortcut to adding data to Apple's Health app.


#### And Chill (Sexual Activity)
• Logs a boolean against [HKMetadataKeySexualActivityProtectionUsed](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkmetadatakeysexualactivityprotectionused) for the [sexualActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcategorytypeidentifier/1615769-sexualactivity) category, and a _start_ date.

#### Autooth (Toothbrushing)
• Logs a value of ["Not Applicable"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcategoryvalue/notapplicable) against the [toothbrushingEvent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcategorytypeidentifier/3172591-toothbrushingevent) category, and a _start_ and _end_ date.
