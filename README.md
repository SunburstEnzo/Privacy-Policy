# "and Chill" Privacy Policy


## What is collected

Nothing. I literally do not care. No information is stored in the app and there is never a transfer of data over the Internet except through the iAds. I do not collect information on the way you use the app or any way to target the ads to you. This app is a simple shortcut to adding data to Apple's Health app.

The app uses Apple's APIs which it allows developers to use in certain ways and due to the simplicty of the app, it literally only sets a boolean and a start date. There is currently no support for anything else supplied by Apple, however this may change and I may have to change the app to support this. If this is the case I will remind users the terms have changed and must explicitly agree to the changes made by Apple.
